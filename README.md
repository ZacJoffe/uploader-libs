# Uploader Libraries
Golang libraries for consuming [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/), [Imgur](https://imgur.com), and [Quad](https://quad.pe/)'s RESTful APIs.

The APIs for [Gfycat](https://developers.gfycat.com/) and [Imgur](https://apidocs.imgur.com/) are publicly available, but Quad's is not. The calls were reverse engineered through Chromium's network inspector.

See `main.go` in the root folder for library usage.
